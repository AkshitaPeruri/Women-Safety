SYNOPSIS:
Women in Indian cities face widespread public harassment, from stalking to abuse and assault. This study examines the role of social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram in promoting women's safety. It highlights how social media can foster societal responsibility and awareness among the Indian population. Tweets featuring messages, images, and hashtags help educate youth and encourage action against harassment. These platforms also serve as a space for women to share their experiences, expressing how safe they feel in public spaces, at work, or on public transport, and highlighting the urgent need for change


PURPOSE: 
Results of the sentimental analysis can be used in many areas like sentiments regarding a particular brand or release of a product, analyzing public opinions on the government policies, people thoughts on women, etc.In order to perform classification of tweets and analyze the outcome, a lot of study has been done on the data obtained by the twitter. We also review some studies on machine learning in this paper and research on how to perform sentimental analysis using that domain on twitter data

IMPLEMENTATION: 

• upload dataset: using this module we will upload dataset  
• Dataset cleaning: using this module we will find out empty values in the dataset and replace with mean or 0 values.  
• Train & Test Split: Using this module we will split dataset into two parts called and training and testing. All machine learning algorithms take 80% dataset to train classifier and 20% dataset is used to test 
  classifier prediction accuracy.
